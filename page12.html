    </p></span>
    <span id="iconDescription"><p>The Americans' main contributions to the Philippines are education, government systems, public health, urban planning, and culture. In 1901, an act was passed providing for free primary education and the establishment of schools in Manila (Sobritchea, 1990). Under the Americans, English was not only taught to every Filipino school child but was adopted as the medium of instruction in all public schools (Casambre, 1982).</p>
        Similar to the structure of the US government, the Philippine government is also composed of three separate and interdependent branches as well as a democratic system modeled on the US system (‚ÄúSimilarities of the U.S. and Philippine Legal Systems,‚Äù 2018).<br><br>
            In terms of public health, the Board of Health for the Philippine Islands was established in 1901 to improve public sanitation and to combat diseases (Department of Health, 2014).<br><br>
            Urban planning and architecture were also improved during the time including Baguio City which was designed by Daniel Burnham and the construction of Gabaldon School Buildings by Isauro Gabaldon (Zarsadiaz, 2021).<br><br>
            Lastly, American culture also influenced emerging art forms during the time including the Philippine Constabulary Band and the Manila Carnival.
