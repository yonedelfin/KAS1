    <span id="iconDescription"><p>The Japanese invasion of the Philippines started on the 8th of December 1941, approximately 17 hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor (Pacific Atrocities Education, n.d.).</p>
        The main motivation behind the colonization was due to the Philippines' strategic location for oil transport. Additionally, the Japanese had a doctrine called the ‚ÄúGreater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere‚Äù which was their attempt to establish an empire and control other countries to use their resources (Dean, n.d.).
