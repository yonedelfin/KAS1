    </p></span>
    <span id="iconDescription"><p>There have been many local uprisings throughout the Spanish colonial era but it was only in the 19th century that a group of Ilustrados emerged and fought for Philippine Independence. This emergence of nationalism was sparked by the Cavite Mutiny and the execution of Jos√© Burgos, Mariano G√≥mez, and Jacinto Zamora (GomBurZa).</p>
        Fueled by the desire for reform and independence, Jose Rizal lead the Propaganda Movement and exposed the harsh realities faced by Filipinos in his novel Noli me t√°ngere. Andres Bonifacio, also known as the ‚ÄúFather of the Philippine Revolution‚Äù, established the KKK as a revolutionary society and soon called for an armed rebellion. Another Filipino revolutionary named Emilio Aguinaldo led carefully planned battles and successfully drove the Spanish out of their area (‚ÄúPhilippine Revolution,‚Äù 2020).  <br><br>
        During the Spanish-American War, Filipino rebels led by Emilio Aguinaldo declare Philippine independence after 300 years of Spanish rule. The annexation of the Philippines, however, resulted in another colonial rule by the Americans. As a result, Aguinaldo and other revolutionaries fled to exile, returning to the Philippines only in 1898. At the Battle of Manila Bay, American troops defeated the Spanish fleet, allowing Aguinaldo to return to the Philippines and aid the US in its war against Spain. On June 12, he declared Philippine independence and established a provincial government, which he later became the head of (‚ÄúPhilippine independence declared,‚Äù 2010).
