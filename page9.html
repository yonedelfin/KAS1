    Friars were also given lands by the Spanish government for their evangelization missions.  The friars had held these lands for centuries. The religious orders would not sell these lands of their own accord, and thus the Filipino agriculturists who desired to utilize them were prevented either from buying or renting (Cunningham, 1916). As a result, these lands became idle and the colonial economy was stagnant and had no opportunity for growth.

    In the early 19th century, political reforms were taking place in Spain, and by extension, in the Philippines. The Cadiz Constitution of 1812 reduced the power of the monarchy and the Church. It was also implemented in Manila with provisions including individual liberties (Abinales & Amoroso, 2017).
