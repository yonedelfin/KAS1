    <span id="iconDescription"><p>Life in the Philippines was difficult during the Japanese occupation. Only one political party was allowed during the occupation which was the Japanese-organized KALIBAPI (Rottman, 2001).</p>Numerous war crimes against Filipino and American civilians were also documented during this time. Mothers, women and gay men were imprisoned and tortured, leading to the emergence of ‚Äúcomfort women‚Äù for the Japanese. As a result, there was an increase in resistance by the guerillas. By the end of the war, around 277 guerilla units fought in the movement and some would be reorganized as units of the Philippine Army (Hunt, 2000).
